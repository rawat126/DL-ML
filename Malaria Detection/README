Malaria is a deadly, infectious mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. These parasites are transmitted by the bites 
of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.It is pretty clear that malaria is prevalent across the globe especially in tropical regions.
The motivation for this project is however based on the nature and fatality of this disease.
                                                    Initially if an infected mosquito bites you, parasites carried by the mosquito
 will get in your blood and start destroying oxygen-carrying RBCs (red blood cells). Typically the first symptoms of malaria
 are similar to the flu or a virus when you usually start feeling sick within a few days or weeks after the mosquito bite. However 
 these deadly parasites can live in your body for over a year without any problems! Thus, a delay in the right treatment can lead
 to complications and even death. Hence early and effective testing and detection of malaria can save lives.
                                                  There are several methods and tests which can be used for malaria detection and
diagnosis.We will discuss briefly about a standard malaria diagnosis, based on a typical blood-smear workflow

 Thus, malaria detection is definitely an intensive manual process which can perhaps be automated using deep learning which forms 
 the basis of this article. The Original Approch used in this Project is used from (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1907/1907.10418.pdf),2019
