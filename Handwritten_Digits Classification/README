HandWritten Numerical Digits Classification on the famous MNIST Dataset with 70,000 total images
from (0 to 9) of 8x8 size. The 60,000 Data is used for training and 10,000 data used for testing 
in this model.
The model Tested on two Algorithums :
1.) K-nearest neighbour (Machine learning Algorithim)
2.) Deep Neural Network

Both results are compared and The testing done on real-time Data eith best approch towards preprocessing 
of raw Data.
