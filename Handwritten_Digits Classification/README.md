Project
============================================
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits differs in case of every single indivisual, but still there are recognizable patterns and the Mordern Techniques like Deep Learning and Machine Learning will help in better identification of digits from the whole-range of 0 to 9. The project shows both the results achived results of ML-algorithum and DL-algorithum

Project Highlights
============================================
 ## 1.)  Data Collection
The datasets are available [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and even it's preloaded in tensorflow Datasets both(1.41 and 2.x)

## 2.)  Data Preprocessing
For Data preprocessing we have
